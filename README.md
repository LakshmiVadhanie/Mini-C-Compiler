# Mini-C-Compiler using C++

This project focuses on building a mini-compiler for an arbitrary language. Where ther input to the compiler, is taken from a file during execution, and is preprocessed and checked . If it has some specific functionality (like some basic operations â€“ add, subtract, divide, etc.),  or any if-else condition, or any loop. If Yes then the respectiveoperation is executed and displayed to the console as the output. For the output and building of the compiler, the C++ 
language is chosen as it can run on any platform with no unique setup.
